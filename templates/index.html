                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-12 col-md-3" align="center">

                        <p class="text-justify">A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation of whole-blood components). Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly (the latter called apheresis). Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p class="text-justify">Potential donors are evaluated for anything that might make their blood unsafe to use. The screening includes testing for diseases that can be transmitted by a blood transfusion, including HIV and viral hepatitis. The donor must also answer questions about medical history and take a short physical examination to make sure the donation is not hazardous to his or her health. How often a donor can donate varies from days to months based on what component they donate and the laws of the country where the donation takes place. For example, in the United States, donors must wait eight weeks (56 days) between whole blood donations but only seven days between plateletpheresis donations and twice per seven-day period in plasmapheresis.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The amount of blood drawn and the methods vary. The collection can be done manually or with automated equipment that takes only specific components of the blood. Most of the components of blood used for transfusions have a short shelf life, and maintaining a constant supply is a persistent problem. This has led to some increased interest in autotransfusion, whereby a patient's blood is salvaged during surgery for continuous reinfusion—or alternatively, is "self-donated" prior to when it will be needed. (Generally, the notion of "donation" does not refer to giving to one's self, though in this context it has become somewhat acceptably idiomatic.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The need for safe and secure supplies of blood and blood products is universal. Globally, at least 90 million units of blood are donated each year to save lives and improve health. Nevertheless, the demand for blood transfusion is on the increases, and many countries can’t meet their needs of blood. In many countries, this means inadequate supplies to replace the blood lost in childbirth and to treat anemia that threatens the lives of children who have malaria or undernourished. Everywhere, blood and blood products are needed for routine and emergency surgery, including life-saving treatment for growing numbers of people injured in traffic accidents, and for treating congenital blood disorders.</p>

            <h3>Blood Types</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Blood types are very important when transferring blood from a person to another. Blood types are classified as A, B, AB or O and the Rh factor. The Rh factor refers to the presence or absence of a specific antigen, a substance capable of stimulating an immune response, in the blood. So you're either Rh positive or Rh negative, meaning you carry the antigen or you don't, i.e. if your blood group is (A+ve) that means that your blood type is A and your Rh factor is positive and (A-ve) means that your blood type is A and your Rh factor is negative. Positive Rh is more common that negative Rh since it is a dominate gene.</p>

                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">In emergencies, blood type O can be given to anyone. A group AB individual can receive blood from any group and donate plasma to all blood groups. The blood type O, thus, is reckoned an all-giving group, while the blood type AB is regarded as the receiver-from-all group.</p>

                        <li>Medical examinations will be conducted, including checking temperature, pulse, blood pressure and weight.</li>
                        <li>A blood sample will be taken to check hemoglobin levels and blood type. Also blood will be checked up to determine whether it is safe and free of contagious diseases that can be transmitted by blood transfusion, such as HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis.  </li>
                        <li>All the used medical equipments are sterile, and will be used only once and then disposed of.</li>
                        <li>You'll feel a little pinch as the needle goes in. It is normal to feel dizzy while taking blood.</li>
